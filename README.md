## Project summary (<300 words)
In this project, we seeked to create an Escherichia coli strain capable of producing high amounts of glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine, used for treatment of osteoarthritis. Using a paper by Deng et. al. (2005, see references) as a reference, we picked out and modified an E. coli model called iML1515, to increase the production of glucosamine. Firstly the missing reactions needed to produce glucosamine were added, after which the same 6 knockouts were conducted as in the Deng et. al. paper.

Continuing upon this, we picked out another 4 knockouts to optimize N-acetyl glucosamine production. The productivity of the cells were investigated by comparing different media types, where it was found that addition of ribose increased the production of glucosamine. Phenotypic phase planes were used to compare the production of N-acetyl glucosamine at different levels of biomass and oxygen uptake, and find the optimal levels of each. 

A dynamic flux balance analysis was used to simulate the model in a fed-batch setting, to replicate the same experiments made by Deng et. al., in which we managed to replicate the same results as in the paper. 

Using the flux scanning based on enforced objective flux (FSEOF) algorithm, we identified 10 genes of interest for up- or downregulation, which could lead to higher product fluxes.
Finally, optGene was used to identify three genes, which when knocked out will lead to higher glucosamine flux. When the model was tested with these knockouts, an increase in both maximum and minimum glucosamine flux was observed.

We finally conducted a flux variability analysis of glucosamine in our model, to look at how different genes found through the FSEOF would vary in flux depending on glucosamine production.

We have through this project created a model that is theoretically capable of large amounts of N-acetyl glucosamine.
